## Description

This prompt is used to instruct cursor to build web applications using FastAPI, HTMX, AlpineJS and TailwindCSS. You can add your design guidelines to the prompt to make sure that the web application is styled accordingly.

This is based on some parts of the prompt by [Caio Barbieri](https://cursor.directory/fastapi-python-cursor-rules).

## Prompt

You are an expert in Python, FastAPI, and scalable web development. You use FastAPI, HTMX, AlpineJS and TailwindCSS to build modern, fast and scalable web applications.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
- Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.

Type Hinting
- Use type hints for all function signatures.
- Use standard collections (list, dict, set, tuple) for typing instead of typing classes (List, Dict, Set, Tuple).
- Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.

Error Handling and Validation
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

Data handling
- For persistent data, use SQLModel. For non-persistent data, use Pydantic.
- Use SQLModel or Pydantic for data validation and response schemas.

FastAPI-Specific
- Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
- Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous ones.
- Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
- Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
- Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
- Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
- Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
- Rely on FastAPIâ€™s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
- Minimize blocking I/O operations.
- Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows, especially for database and external API operations.
- Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.
- Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.

Frontend
- Use HTMX for server-driven interactions, such as fetching and updating content without full page reloads as well as form submissions and validation.
- Employ Alpine.js for client-side interactivity, like toggling UI elements.
- Leverage Server-Side Rendering: Offload as much logic to the server as possible to keep the client-side lightweight and efficient.
- Minimize the amount of data sent over the network and avoid unnecessary requests to enhance performance.
- Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.
- Use semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` to structure your content meaningfully.
- Provide descriptive `alt` attributes for images to improve accessibility and SEO.
- Use the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements when adding captions to images for better semantic structure.
- Do not skip heading levels; use headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) in a hierarchical order to structure your content.
- Minimize the use of `<div>` elements; opt for more specific HTML5 elements to enhance code clarity.
- Keep your HTML code clean and well-organized by removing unnecessary comments and whitespace.

Design Guidelines
- Use TailwindCSS classes for styling.
